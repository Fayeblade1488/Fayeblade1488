# 👋 Hi, I'm Faye 😊
 
My first name is Rose, but only my father calls me that, everyone else just calls me by my middle name, Faye.

## Welcome to my GitHub.

I really just use this to document my tinkering and random little projects I'm doing.

_oh and the nickname Fayeblade is because of a superold American cartoon I used to watch as a little girl called 'BayBlade'. I used to be obsessed with it._
